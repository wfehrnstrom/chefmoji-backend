This project requires that docker, python3.8 >=, pip, make and curl be pre-installed
Install those, then run 'make install'. Then run the command `export FLASK_APP=src/app.py`.
This tells the flask command where the application to run is located. Also be sure to ask 
for the .env file from a project member that has it.
