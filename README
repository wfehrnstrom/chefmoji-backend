# Installing required components and general set up

This project requires that docker, python3.8 >=, pip, make and curl be pre-installed
Install those, then run 'make install'. Then run the command `export FLASK_APP=src/app.py`.
This tells the flask command where the application to run is located. Also be sure to obtain a .env file
from a project maintainer that has one, and place it in the src directory.

# Running Backend

run 'make dev'
